## Overall Considerations

This is the complete source code for **Quake 2**, version **3.19**, buildable with
**visual C++ 6.0**.  The **linux** version should be buildable, but we haven't
tested it for the release.

The code is all licensed under the terms of the **GPL (gnu public license)**.  
You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch 
is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the 
entire source code available for free to everyone.

The primary intent of this release is for **entertainment** and **educational 
purposes**, but the **GPL** does allow **commercial exploitation** if you obey the 
full license.  If you want to do something commercial and you just can't bear 
to have your **source changes released**, we could still negotiate a separate 
license agreement (for **$$$**), but I would encourage you to just live with the 
**GPL**.

All of the **Q2** data files remain **copyrighted** and licensed under the 
original terms, so you cannot redistribute data from the original game, but if 
you do a true total conversion, you can create a **standalone game** based on 
**this code**.

Thanks to **Robert Duffy** for doing the grunt work of building this release.

## About **Quake 2**

**Quake II** is a **first-person shooter** video game developed by **id Software** and published by **Activision**. It is not a direct sequel to **Quake**; id decided to revert to an existing trademark when they were unable to agree on a new name that did not violate another company's trademark.[3]

The soundtrack for **Quake II** was mainly provided by **Sonic Mayhem**, with some additional tracks by **Bill Brown**; the main theme was also composed by **Bill Brown** and **Rob Zombie**, and one track was by **Jer Sypult**.

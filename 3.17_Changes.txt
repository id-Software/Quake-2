
Quake2 3.17 Upgrade
-------------------

This upgrade addresses several features, including security, playability, and
enhancements.

Changes for 3.17
----------------

- Fixed possible NAN resulting from handing zero to second arg of atan2
- Autodownloading is now DISABLED by DEFAULT.  It must be enabled by typing
  'allow_download 1' at the console, or using the download options menu
  in Multiplayer/PlayerSetup/Download Options
- Server demos now include a svc_serverdata block at the beginning with the
  attractloop byte set to '2' to indicate server demo (byte before gamedir
  in the svc_serverdata block).  This allows easy identification of
  serverrecorded demos (serverrecord demos are only for demo editors, they
  can not be played back in Quake2 without being first edited).
- New options for setting texture formats in ref_gl:
  gl_texturealphamode:  default, GL_RGBA, GL_RGBA8, GL_RGB5_A1, GL_RGBA4, 
    GL_RGBA2
  gl_texturesolidmode:  default, GL_RGB, GL_RGB8, GL_RGB5, GL_RGB4,
    GL_R3_G3_B2, GL_RGB2 (SGI only)
- Player movement during Air acceleration changed to reflect more real-world 
  physics while airborne.
- Fixed a bug when riding trains that caused drift in a southwest direction
  (Thanks to Jim Dose at Ritual for pointing this one out).
- Linux:  Now correctly reports out of memory rather than segfaulting (mmap
  returns (void *)-1 and not NULL on error).
- Fixed autodownloading to not create paths for files that can't be downloaded
  (this was creating many empty directories in baseq2/players).
- When downloading a file from a server that doesn't have it, the message is
  now "Server does not have this file" rather than "File not found."
- Fixed some coop keys in 3.15 weren't being handled correctly (pyramid key).
- Highbits are now stripped from console when using condump
- Restored support for gl_modulate in multiplayer play
- Fixed it so that players with a model/skin you don't have aren't checked for 
  on disk more than once.
- Fixed it so sounds played for PPMs that default to male are only checked
  on disk once.
- Byte ordering/portability fixes in cinematics, PCX and other file handling.
- Client state during static image cinematic (PCX image) so that client can 
  continue to next unit.
- Fixed it so that dedicated coop servers no longer get stuck at victory.pcx,
  if a server is in coop mode, hitting a button at the victory.pcx screen
  while cause the server to restart at base1
- Fixed infinite grenade bug
- Fixed autodownloading to actually download sounds and console pics
- Fixed autodownload to not create empty directories for files not on
  the server.
- Added customized client downloading.  cvars are the same as the server side:
    allow_download - global download on/off
    allow_download_players - players download on/off
    allow_download_models - models download on/off
    allow_download_sounds - sounds download on/off
    allow_download_maps - maps download on/off
  They can also be (more easily) set with a new Download Options menu 
  accessible in Multiplayer/Player Setup/Download Options
- Changed checksumming code to be more portable and faster.
  The checksum in 3.15 was seriously broken.
  This change makes 3.17 incompatible with previous servers.
- Fixed player 'warping' present in 3.15 (this was an artifact of the
  hyperblaster optimizations).
- Fixed the autodownload in 3.15 so that stuff like skins for models are
  downloaded as well as pics.

Changes for 3.15
----------------

- Added visible weapons support.  This is precached with a special symbol, i.e.
  gi.modelindex("#w_shotgun.md2") which causes the client to autobind it to
  the players current weapon model.  Plug in player models can optionally 
  support the visible weapons.  Any that do not support it will use their
  default weapon.md2 files automatically.
  Visible weapons files for plug in player models are not downloaded
  automatically--only the default weapon.md2 (and skin) is.
  The Visible weapon models themselves are not included.  They can be
  downloaded from http://www.telefragged.com/vwep/
- Rewrote the some of the net code to use optimized network packets for 
  projectiles.  This is transparent to the game code, but improves netplay
  substancially.  The hyperblaster doesn't flood modem players anymore.
- Rewrote the packet checksum code to be more portable and defeat proxy bots
  yet again.
- Autodownload support is in.  The following items will be automatcally
  downloaded as needed:
    - world map (and textures)
    - models
    - sounds (precached ones)
    - plug in player model, skin, skin_i and weapon.md2
  downloads go to a temp file (maps/blah.tmp for example) and get renamed
  when done.  autoresume is supported (if you lose connect during the
  download, just reconnect and resume).  Server has fine control over
  the downloads with the following new cvars:
    allow_download - global download on/off
    allow_download_players - players download on/off
    allow_download_models - models download on/off
    allow_download_sounds - sounds download on/off
    allow_download_maps - maps download on/off
  maps that are in pak files will _not_ autodownload from the server, this
  is for copyright considerations.
  The QuakeWorld bug of the server map changing while download a map has
  been fixed.
- New option in the Multiplayer/Player Setup menu for setting your connection
  speed.  This sets a default rate for the player and can improve net
  performance for modem connections.
- Rewrote some of the save game code to make it more portable.  I wanted to
  completely rewrite the entire save game system and make it portable across
  versions and operating systems, but this would require an enormous amount
  of work.
- Added another 512 configure strings for general usage for mod makers.
  This gives lots of room for general string displays on the HUD and in other
  data.
- Player movement code re-written to be similiar to that of NetQuake and
  later versions of QuakeWorld.  Player has more control in the air and
  gets a boost in vertical speed when jumping off the top of ramps.
- Fixed up serverrecord so that it works correctly with the later versions.
  serverrecord lets the server do a recording of the current game that
  demo editors can use to make demos from any PVS in the level.  Server
  recorded demos are BIG.  Will look at using delta compression in them
  to cut down the size.
- Copy protection CD check has been removed.
- Quake2 3.15 has changed the protocol (so old servers will not run) but
  all existing game dlls can run on the new version (albiet without the
  new features such as visible weapons).
- Added flood protection.  Controlled from the following cvars:
   flood_msgs - maximum number of messages allowed in the time period
                specified by flood_persecond
   flood_persecond - time period that a maximum of flood_msgs messages are
                     permitted
   flood_waitdelay - amount of time a client gets muzzled for flooding
  (gamex86 DLL specific)
- fixed it so blaster/hyperblaster shots aren't treated as solid when
  predicting--you aren't clipped against them now.
  (gamex86 DLL specific, the SVF_DEADMONSTER flag is set on projectiles)
- gender support is now in.  The userinfo cvar "gender" can be set to
  male/female/none (none for neutral messages).  This doesn't affect sounds
  but does affect death messages in the game.  The models male and cyborg
  default to gender male, and female and crackhor default to female.
  Everything else defaults to none, but you can set it by typing
  "gender male" or "gender female" as appropriate.
- IP banning support ala QW.  It's built into the game dll as 'sv' console
  commands.  This list is:
    sv addip <ip-mask>  - adds an ip to the ban list
	sv listip <ip-mask> - removes an ip from the ban list
	sv writeip - writes the ban list to <gamedir>/listip.cfg.  You can
	  exec this on a server load to load the list on subsequent server runs.
	  like so:  quake2 +set dedicated 1 +exec listip.cfg
	sv removeip <ip-mask> - remove an ip from the list
  the ip list is a simple mask system.  Adding 192.168 to the list
  would block out everyone in the 192.168.*.* net block.  You get 1024 bans,
  if you need more, recompile the game dll. :)
  A new cvar is also supported called 'filterban'.  It defaults to one which
  means "allow everyone to connect _except_ those matching in the ban list."
  If you set it to zero, the meaning reverses like so, "don't allow anyone
  to connect unless they are in the list."
  (gamex86 DLL specific)

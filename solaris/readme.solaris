Quake2 Dedicated 3.20 For Sun Solaris (x86 and Sparc)
-----------------------------------------------------

Please see the readme.txt file included for general information about the
game.  This file contains Solaris specific information.

Requirements
------------

Solaris x86 2.5.1 or later, Sun Solaris Sparc 2.5.1 or later.

Installation
------------

To install the Quake2 data files, mount your Quake2 CD and copy
the directory install/data to the location where you want Quake2.  You
can also symlink it, but I don't recommend that.  Around 200MB of disk
space is required for a full installation.

For example:
  cp -r /mnt/cdrom/install/data/* /usr/games/quake2

This binary only runs as a dedicated server and requires no special
user permissions.

You can also set dmflags, timelimit, etc. in a config file, like so:
  set timelimit 20
  set fraglimit 25
  set dmflags 532
  map fact3

Then exec that config file on load, like so:

  ./q2ded +exec server.cfg

If you use a config file, you must put a 'map' command in it or the
server won't load a map.

To run a dedicated server in the background, use this;

	nohup ./q2ded +exec server.cfg &

A better way is to run Quake2 on a tty via screen.  screen can be found
at ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/screen-3.7.4.tar.gz.

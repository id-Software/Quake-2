Quake2 3.20 For Linux
---------------------

Please see the readme.txt file included for general information about the
game.  This file contains Linux specific information.

Please see the file 3.20_Changes.txt for changes from previous versions.

Requirements
------------

Quake2 for Linux supports the following video subsystems:

- SVGALib Console Graphics (ref_soft.so)
	- Requires SVGALib 1.2.0 or later
- X11 Window Graphics (ref_softx.so)
	- X11R5 or later, XShm shared memory extension supported
- 3DFX fxMesa with Mesa 3-D or 3DFX Miniport (ref_gl.so)
	- Mesa 3-D 2.6 or later, specifically compiled for 3DFX support
	  Mesa 3-D 2.6 compiled with 3DFX support is provided with this archive.
- Generic glX (X11) based OpenGL (ref_glx.so)
	- Requires a glX based hardware accelerated OpenGL implementation.
	  Mesa 3-D 2.6 supports this on 3DFX hardware.

Also included is a specific 3DFX mini-OpenGL implementation for running Quake2
on 3DFX hardware.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have the appropirate hardware, drivers and libraries installed
for the renderer you are going to play on.

Quake2 for Linux supports the following renderers:

- ref_soft
  Software rendering under SVGALib (console only).  SVGALib 1.2.10 or later
  is required.  Note that SVGALib 1.2.11 supports the ability to run a
  SVGALib application under X11 as it will automatically allocate a new
  console.  The default mode is 320x240 (ModeX) since that is the lowest
  resolution supported by Quake2.  If SVGALib supports your video card, higher
  resolution modes such as 640x480 and 800x600 are also supported.

  Please note that you may need to configure your mouse for SVGALib in
  /etc/vga/libvga.config (or /etc/libvga.config).

- ref_softx
  Software rendering under X11.  This uses the MITSHM Extension and should
  work will virtually all Linux X Servers.  **NOTE: Do not resize the window
  under X11.  You must use the Video menu to change resolution/window size.

  By default, the mouse will not be 'tied' to the Quake2 window.  To cause
  Quake2 to grab the mouse, select 'Windowed Mouse' from the video menu,
  or type '_windowed_mouse 0' at the console.  Do the reverse to release it.
  You can bind keys to grab and release the mouse in the console, like so:
    bind i "_windowed_mouse 1"  
    bind o "_windowed_mouse 0"  
  Then "i" will grab the mouse and "o" will release it.

- ref_gl
  This render can be run with two different OpenGL drivers:  Mesa 3-D
  ontop of Linux GLIDE, or 3DFX's mini-OpenGL Quake driver. 
  For Mesa 3-D, the necessary libMesaGL.so.2.6 is included with this archive.  
  You must copy it to /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib and run ldconfig (as root)
  in order to use it.  You can do this as follows:
    tar cf - lib*GL* | (cd /usr/lib; tar xf -)
  You should use tar to keep the symlinks intact. Once you copy them over
  run ldconfig.
  You must also download and install the Linux GLIDE drivers at
  http://www.3dfx.com/software/download_glidel.html
  And install them as instructed.
  RPMs for GLIDE are available at :
     http://glide.xxedgexx.com/3DfxRPMS.html
  With version 3.20, the GL library is entirely runtime loaded.  This means
  you can specify what shared object to load for GL display.
  To use Mesa 3-D GL (console), run quake with:
  	 ./quake2 +set vid_ref gl +set gl_driver libMesaGL.so.2
  To use the 3DFX OpenGL Miniport, run the included quake2.3dfxgl:
     ./quake2 +set vid_ref gl +set gl_driver lib3dfxgl.so
  The gl_driver cvar indicates the name of the library to load for GL
  functions.  It can be in any directory listed in /etc/ld.so.conf
  or in /etc/quake2.conf

  **NOTE:  There is a problem on libc5 systems where a vid_restart (causing
  a reload of the video system) will crash.  There doesn't seem to be a 
  solution to this yet.  It looks to be some sort of ld.so dynamic loading
  interaction with SVGALib and ref_gl.so.  A work around is to start in
  software mode (./quake2 +set vid_ref soft), then use the menu to set your
  mode and a vid_restart will work when going from software to GL.  Exit
  out then and save your video mode settings.
  This problem does not occur on libc6 (glibc) based systems; vid_restart
  works fine on there.

- ref_glx
  ref_glx should run on many different hardward OpenGL implementations under
  Linux and X11.  This binary is an X11 application and must be run under
  X11.  It will work with Mesa 3-D as a standard glX based OpenGL 
  applications.  If the Mesa 3-D library is compiled with 3DFX support,
  you can have Mesa 3-D support 3DFX hardware under X11 by setting the
  enviroment variable "MESA_GLX_FX" to "fullscreen" for fullscreen mode
  and "window" for windowed mode, eg. "export MESA_GLX_FX=fullscreen" for sh 
  or "setenv MESA_GLX_FX fullscreen" for csh.

  As with ref_gl, the "gl_driver" cvar indicates the shared library to load
  for OpenGL functions (the glX functions must provided in that library
  as well).

To install the Quake2 data files, mount your Quake2 CD and copy
the directory install/data to the location where you want Quake2.  You
can also symlink it, but I don't recommend that.  Around 200MB of disk
space is required for a full installation.

For example:
  cp -r /mnt/cdrom/install/data/* /usr/games/quake2

Permissions
-----------

Quake2 requires root permissions to use the software (SVGALib) and GL (MesaGL
w/3dfx) renders.  In order to make this secure, some special considerations
must be made.

Quake2 should get setuid root:
	chown root quake2
	chmod 4711 quake2

And the ref_soft.so and ref_gl.so files must owned by root.

The file /etc/quake2.conf must be installed.  This file contains a single
line with the path of where the ref shared libraries can be found.
A sample one is included that lists /usr/games/quake2 as the default
path.  The libraries are only loaded out of the directory listed in
/etc/quake2.conf for security considerations.

Special permissions are not required for the softx renderer, but quake2 may
still need to be setuid root to open the sound device (quake2 will give up
setuid root permissions before loading softx).

NOTE:  If you use a setuid quake2 binary and run it as a normal user, it
will NOT be able to switch renderers on the fly because root permissions
are given up after the renderer is loaded.  You can switch renderers on the
fly if you run quake2 as root (su or log in as root).

NOTE:  When the quake2 binary is run in dedicated server mode
(+set dedicated 1), no special permissions are required and 
/etc/quake2.conf is not read since no renderer is loaded.

----

The first time you run Quake2, it will use ref_soft or ref_softx based
on whether a DISPLAY environment variable exists.

To force the loading of a specific renderer at load time, use the following
command lines:

	./quake2 +set vid_ref soft
	./quake2 +set vid_ref softx
	./quake2 +set vid_ref gl
	./quake2 +set vid_ref glx

Linux Specific Cvars
--------------------

To set this, use +set on the command line, i.e.:
	./quake2 +set cd_dev /dev/hdc +set sndmono 1

nocdaudio (defaults to 0)
  Do not enable cd audio if not zero

sndbits (defaults to 16)
  Set sound bit sample size.

sndspeed (defaults to 0)
  Set sound speed.  Usual values are 8000, 11025, 22051 and 44100.
  If set to zero, causes the sound driver to attempt speeds in the following
  order:  11025, 22051, 44100, 8000.

sndchannels (defaults to 2)
  Indicates stereo or mono sound.  Defaults to 2 (stereo). Use 1 for mono.

nostdout (defaults to 0)
  Whether to output console msgs to standard out.  Non-zero is cease output.

Dedicated server
----------------

To run Linux Quake2 as a dedicated server, just run it as follows:

  ./quake2 +set dedicated 1

You can also set dmflags, timelimit, etc. in a config file, like so:
  set timelimit 20
  set fraglimit 25
  set dmflags 532
  map fact3

Then exec that config file on load, like so:

  ./quake2 +set dedicated 1 +exec server.cfg

If you use a config file, you must put a 'map' command in it or the
server won't load a map.

To run a dedicated server in the background, use this;

	nohup ./quake2 +set dedicated 1 +exec server.cfg &

A better way is to run Quake2 on a tty via screen.  screen can be found
at ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/screen-3.7.4.tar.gz, but it comes with
most modern Linux installations now.
